# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project explores time-series stock price prediction using machine learning techniques in Python. The objective was to understand how different modeling approaches perform on financial market data and to build a complete, reproducible prediction pipeline.

## What I Built
- Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data (e.g. SPY ETF)
- Engineered features and split data into training, validation, and test sets
- Implemented:
  - **LSTM neural network** using PyTorch for sequential time-series modeling
  - **XGBoost** for gradient-boosted tree regression
- Evaluated model performance using error metrics and visual comparisons of predicted vs actual prices

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- PyTorch (LSTM)  
- XGBoost  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

## Key Learnings
- Structuring and cleaning time-series financial data
- Strengths and limitations of deep learning vs tree-based models
- Importance of correct data splitting and avoiding data leakage
- How modeling choices affect predictive performance

## Disclaimer
This is a project, do not use this as a way to invest your money, you will lose money 😂
