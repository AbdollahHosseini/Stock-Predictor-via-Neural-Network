Stock Price Prediction Project

Overview

This project explores time-series stock price prediction using machine learning techniques in Python. The goal was to understand how different modeling approaches perform on financial market data and to build an end-to-end prediction pipeline.

What I Built
	•	Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data (e.g. SPY ETF)
	•	Engineered features and split data into training, validation, and test sets
	•	Implemented:
	•	LSTM neural network using PyTorch for sequential time-series modeling
	•	XGBoost for gradient-boosted tree regression
	•	Evaluated model performance using error metrics and visual comparisons of predicted vs actual prices

Tools & Technologies
	•	Python
	•	PyTorch (LSTM)
	•	XGBoost
	•	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Key Learnings
	•	How to structure and clean time-series financial data
	•	The strengths and limitations of deep learning vs tree-based models
	•	The importance of proper data splitting and avoiding data leakage
	•	How small modeling choices can significantly impact predictive performance
